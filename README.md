# hacktrack: Move windows by four fingers on trackpad, resize by five, and more...
Being spoiled by window management on both Linux and Mac, I want all the good things combined. Three-finger swipe to change desktop? Great. Alt+mouse anywhere to move/resize window? Much better than aiming at tiny GUI parts but do I really have to reach for both the keyboard and mouse? Four fingers on trackpad should move windows, right? After all, mouse feels evil being spoiled by Mac trackpad. So after a vain search for a system I could configure to respond really well, I wrote this little goody. And I absolutely love my window management now.

## Prerequisities
* **Apple Magic Trackpad 2.** This is an absolutely amazing piece of hardware, even much better than you guess from a Mac experience. Did you know it precisely detects up to 11 fingers? :) And shapes of their touch areas. And pressure.
* **Big screen.** Window management is not important on laptop when you work mostly fullscreen. Things are quite different on something like 31.5" EIZO EV3285.
* **Linux desktop like Xfce4.** You need to be able to programatically move windows etc. and most Linux desktops will let you do that.
